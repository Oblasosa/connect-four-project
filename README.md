Connect 4 Project

First large project in the Springboard track. 
Utilizies everything learned up to this point. 
Goal is to get the game running while following the directions.

Honestly, it was pretty tough for me without peeking at the solution towards the end. 
I can comprehend most of the concepts required and only needed some help 
tweaking a few things which helps my imposter syndrome lol
